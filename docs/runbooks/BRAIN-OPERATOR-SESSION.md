# Brain operator session (W1.6)

> **Who this is for.** Hleb, running a **live** Afframe Brain booking session from his Mac against the
> deployed accounting MCP endpoint, pushing a real org's documents through the **HELD write loop**. This is the
> operator counterpart to [`BRAIN-CC-HARNESS.md`](BRAIN-CC-HARNESS.md) (which documents the harness internals):

The whole point of a cold-start session: **every write is HELD.** The Brain (an `actor_kind='agent'` API key)
can only _propose_ a capture. The server gate holds it, and you approve/correct it by hand in
[`/{orgSlug}/accounting/approvals`](#6-review-the-held-writes). The agent key is **denied** the review surface,
so it can never approve its own work.

Everything below is accurate to the merged code. The two entry commands are `afframe brain extract` and
`afframe brain book` (the `afframe` bin is `apps/cli`). `afframe brain run` is the single-invoice, JSON-inputs
path the harness scaffold uses; a real document goes through `extract` → `book`.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before a session runs live, all of these must be true:

1. **Production is deployed** and the accounting MCP endpoint answers (`BRAIN_MCP_ENDPOINT`, e.g.
   `https://api.afframe.com/mcp`).
2. **The write lane is ON.** The server admission controller rejects every accounting write with **429** unless
   the runtime kill-switch is active — the client-side `runLiveBrainSession` refuses to even open a session
   unless `BRAIN_RUNTIME_ACTIVE=1` (see [§7](#7-troubleshooting)). It is fail-closed OFF by default.
3. **The target org is scaffolded with accounting structure** — at minimum an open **accounting period** and a
   **DOCUMENT number series**. `brain book` does NOT resolve these; the operator supplies `periodId` /
   `seriesId` / `eventId` verbatim in the `--context` file (they name tenant-side rows, `NOT MCP-resolved`).
4. **A user-bound agent key is issued** for that org (next section).

---

## 2. Issue the agent key

Use the admin UI action, not a hand-written SQL insert.

1. Sign in to the admin app (`admin.afframe.com`) and open **Platform → API keys**
   (`apps/admin/app/(gated)/platform/api-keys`).
2. Click **Issue Brain agent key**. This is gated on the `admin:api_key.create` capability (owner/admin) **plus
   a fresh step-up re-auth** — minting a write-capable agent key forces `requireStepUpForAction`, so you will be
   bounced to `/auth/step-up` if your session is not stepped up.
3. Pick the **organization** and give the key a name (e.g. `Afframe Brain — Acme`), then **Issue key**.
4. **Copy the raw key immediately.** It is shown exactly once and never stored (only its sha256 `key_hash`
   lands in the row). Closing the dialog discards it permanently.

What the action guarantees (`apps/admin/.../api-keys/actions.ts` → `issueBrainAgentKey`):

- `actor_kind` is **HARDCODED to `'agent'`** — never the column's `'human'` default. An agent key may propose
  gated writes but is **denied** the held-write review surface (it can never approve its own writes).
- `workspace_id` is bound to the org's own immutable `organization.workspace_id` (set at scaffold time), never
  taken from input.
- The key is **user-bound**: `created_by_user_id` = the issuing operator, so the write has a responsible person.
  A capture with a key that is not user-bound is rejected **403** ("Accounting writes require a user-bound API
  key").

At capture time, a user-bound **agent** key logs as `actor_kind='ai_on_behalf'` in the audit trail, and an
`ai_on_behalf` row **requires a `conversationId` on every capture** (see [§4](#4-supplying-conversationid) — a
missing one is now a clean **422**, not a 500).

---

## 3. Environment

`brain extract --live` and the `brain book` / `brain run` live loop read these env vars. Names are taken
verbatim from the code — do not invent flags.

| Env var                | Read by                                                                   | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BRAIN_RUNTIME_ACTIVE` | `runLiveBrainSession` gate (`packages/intake/.../brain-cc-harness.ts:45`) | **The write-lane kill-switch. MUST be exactly `"1"`.** A set-but-not-`1` value is still closed. Gates `brain book` / `brain run` live.                                                         |
| `BRAIN_LIVE`           | same gate (`:47`)                                                         | Explicit opt-in that live creds are present and you intend a real session. Any non-empty value passes; unset fails closed.                                                                     |
| `BRAIN_MCP_ENDPOINT`   | `command.ts:186`, gate (`:49`)                                            | The deployed accounting MCP endpoint URL (e.g. `https://api.afframe.com/mcp`).                                                                                                                 |
| `BRAIN_API_KEY`        | `command.ts:187`, gate (`:51`)                                            | The **raw agent key** issued in §2. Resolves org + workspace + responsible user server-side from the principal; never a tool input.                                                            |
| `BRAIN_AGENT_SDK_AUTH` | `command.ts:188`, gate (`:53`)                                            | Agent-SDK auth token. A subscription-auth token for dev sessions (left to the CLI's own credential resolution); an API key (`sk-…`) is force-fed as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the SDK subprocess. |

Notes on scope:

- **`brain extract --live`** checks only three: `BRAIN_MCP_ENDPOINT`, `BRAIN_API_KEY`, `BRAIN_AGENT_SDK_AUTH`
  (`command.ts:189-202`). It does **not** require `BRAIN_RUNTIME_ACTIVE` / `BRAIN_LIVE` — extract never books,
  so it is not behind the write-lane kill-switch. Missing creds fail loud: `brain extract blocked: missing …`.
- **`brain book --live` / `brain run`** go through `runLiveBrainSession`, which requires **all five** vars
  **and** `BRAIN_RUNTIME_ACTIVE=1` **and** a non-empty MCP endpoint, before any launcher runs. Any unmet one
  throws `BrainHarnessNotWiredError` and the CLI prints `brain book blocked: <what is missing>` and exits
  non-zero.
- `BRAIN_ACCOUNTING_POLICY` / `BRAIN_EXTRACT_POLICY` are **not env vars** — they are the pinned in-code sandbox
  policies (`packages/brain`, `apps/cli/.../extract-config.ts`). You do not set them.

### `mlive.example.sh` (committed template)

A secret-free example lives next to this runbook at **[`mlive.example.sh`](mlive.example.sh)**. It sources your
real values from a **gitignored local file** so no secret is ever committed:

```bash
cp docs/runbooks/mlive.example.sh docs/runbooks/mlive.local.sh
# edit docs/runbooks/mlive.local.sh — paste the raw agent key + your creds
source docs/runbooks/mlive.local.sh
```

`docs/runbooks/mlive.local.sh` is **gitignored** (`.gitignore` → `mlive.local.sh`). Never commit it, never
paste a real key into `mlive.example.sh`. The example uses obvious placeholders only.

---

## 4. Run a session

Both paths **print the assembled plan first** (the verbatim `captureRequest` body the live session would embed),
then run the shared inspect → confirm → book tail. Always dry-run once, then run live.

### 4a. A PDF / image (the OCR extract → book bridge)

**Step 1 — extract (LOCAL vision-OCR, never books).** The file is fed to the model as an image/document
**content block**, not via a `Read` tool, and the extract sandbox allows only the OCR-template read/propose
pair. `--context` here is just `{ sections }` (the login-pack safety spine; extract needs no tenancy).

```bash
afframe brain extract ./acme-invoice.pdf --context ./extract-context.json --live
```

This reports an **IR Invoice + field-level provenance + a layout fingerprint**. Review it, then **save the IR
Invoice JSON** (an object with `"record_type": "invoice"`) as `ir.json`.

**Step 2 — book the PDF against its IR.** A single PDF/image argument routes through the bridge; `--extracted`
names the IR file. `extractionMethod` is **forced to `"ocr"`** on this path — a PDF can never be mislabeled
`"structured"`. `--context` here is `{ sections, captureContext }`.

```bash
# dry-run first — assembles + prints only, no creds, contacts nothing
afframe brain book ./acme-invoice.pdf --extracted ./ir.json --context ./book-context.json --dry-run

# then live (write lane must be ON) — --yes skips the interactive confirm for a non-interactive operator
afframe brain book ./acme-invoice.pdf --extracted ./ir.json --context ./book-context.json --yes
```

The dry-run prints whether a **template** matched: if none matched (or the server can't tie it to a **confirmed**
template), the server **fail-closes this OCR capture to HELD** via the `unverified_template` leg (#554).

### 4b. A folder of structured exports

A directory argument keeps the structured flow: `book` walks the folder, parses every leaf (csv / xlsx / Pohoda
dataPack XML) into IR, maps each **bookable** record to a capture, and assembles one plan per record.
`extractionMethod` is stamped **`"structured"`**. Non-booking sources (GLEntry / Attachment) are skipped;
unwired formats (isdoc / pdf / native Pohoda backup / zip / unknown) are reported, not booked.

```bash
# dry-run first
afframe brain book ./acme-exports/ --context ./book-context.json --dry-run

# then live
afframe brain book ./acme-exports/ --context ./book-context.json --yes
```

### The `--context` files

All operator JSON files fail loud at the boundary: a missing required key names the flag + the exact key list,
and any extra key (e.g. a `policy` widening attempt) is **dropped**, never carried through. Money fields are
carried as integer minor-unit **strings** (e.g. `"150000"`), reconstructed as `bigint` — never a float.

- **extract `--context`** → `{ sections }` only.
- **book `--context`** → `{ sections, captureContext }`.

`captureContext` (shape = `IrToCaptureContext`, `packages/intake/src/ir-to-capture.ts`) carries the
operator-supplied uuids + the server-gate envelope:

```jsonc
{
  "sections": {
    /* constitution / KB pointer / law / confidence / escalation texts */
  },
  "captureContext": {
    "periodId": "…uuid…", // open accounting period (NOT MCP-resolved)
    "seriesId": "…uuid…", // DOCUMENT number series (NOT MCP-resolved)
    "eventId": "…uuid…", // accounting-event uuid the line hangs off
    "confidence": 0.5, // client scalar — NECESSARY, never sufficient
    "rationale": "…", // why this booking
    "conversationId": "…", // REQUIRED for the agent key (see §4 below)
    // templateId / signals / extractionMethod are set by the bridge, not here
  },
}
```

### Supplying `conversationId`

The agent key logs as `actor_kind='ai_on_behalf'`, which **requires a `conversationId` on every capture** — omit
it and the server returns **422** ("conversationId is required for a user-bound agent key"). It is **audit
correlation only** (session_id ↔ conversation_id / brain_run_id). Supply it in the `captureContext` block of the
book `--context` file (`conversationId` above). The adapter emits it into the capture request only when present,
so a session without one is a fail-loud 422, not a silent 500.

---

## 5. What happens on a live run

- **Every write is HELD at cold start.** The server gate (`runGatedWrite`, `apps/api/.../accounting-writes.gate.ts`)
  requires a **three-way AND** to auto-apply — client `confidence ≥ threshold` **and** the server veto does not
  hold **and** the server score is green. At cold start the evidence score sits on the `extraction_failed`
  floor, so **green is structurally unreachable → every write returns `202 held`** with a `reviewId`. Nothing
  auto-applies. This is the intended pre-launch posture.
- **The shadow score is recorded.** Since W1.5 (#572, just merged), each capture persists a **second, pure**
  scoring pass at `serverGate.shadow` (jsonb, audit-only, no migration). It is telemetry for the M3 calibration
  refit and is **never** read for the decision — the enforced score keeps its cold-start floor. You do not act
  on it; just know it is being recorded on every capture.
- **The OCR template basis is screened** for an agent key: an OCR capture with no confirmed template basis fires
  `unverified_template` and a found-but-unconfirmed template fires `novel_template` — both force the score to
  HELD. Server-derived and fail-closed; a client can neither forge nor omit past them.

The CLI prints the run result JSON per entry (`brainRunId`, `applied`, `serverGate`). At cold start `applied` is
`false` for everything.

## 6. Review the HELD writes

Held writes are the **human master gate**, and only a human (a member with the org web session) can resolve
them. Open the org web app:

```
https://app.afframe.com/{orgSlug}/accounting/approvals
```

(route: `apps/web/app/[orgSlug]/accounting/approvals/page.tsx`, "Ke schválení"). Each row exposes the full
original payload; you **approve, reject, or correct** it via the `resolveHeldWrite` Server Action (a web
session, not the API).

The agent key **cannot** reach this queue: `HeldWritesController` is class-annotated `@RequireHumanActor()`, so
an `agent`-actor key is rejected **403** on both `list` and `resolve`. There is no path for the Brain to approve
its own write.

A **clean 422** (not a 500) on a missing `conversationId` is the expected, correct behavior — the invariant is
unchanged; only its transport moved to a 4xx at the request boundary.
