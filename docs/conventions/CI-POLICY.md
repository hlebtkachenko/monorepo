# CI Policy

Which checks must pass before a PR can merge, and which are advisory.

## Required vs advisory: today

While the repo is pre-revenue and Hleb is solo, _advisory_ means: the check must run on every PR but a failure does not block merge. _Required_ means: failure blocks merge. The matrix changes when the repo turns private + revenue-generating.

| Check                                     | Today                    | Future (production)         |

[^1]: `knip` is a REQUIRED status check on the `main` ruleset (the job must run and be visible on every PR), but `.github/workflows/knip.yml` uses `continue-on-error: true` on the run step, making it warn-only today. This is intentional: knip found day-1 findings across 101k LOC that require a dedicated owner decision and cleanup pass — silently failing PRs that don't touch dead code would be noise, not signal. Once a dedicated dead-code cleanup issue lands and knip is clean, remove `continue-on-error: true` to make the gate real.

[^2]: `license-check` is implemented at `.github/workflows/_supply-chain.yml:138-167` using `scripts/license-check.mjs` (default-deny posture; allows MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD/ISC/MPL-2.0/etc., denies GPL/AGPL/LGPL). Runs on `release.yml`. Promote to required after one green release cycle.

[^3]: `sbom` is implemented at `.github/workflows/_supply-chain.yml:69-87` using `anchore/sbom-action` (CycloneDX JSON 1.6) with cosign keyless attestation. Runs on `release.yml`. Promote to required after one green release cycle.

[^4]: `provenance` is implemented at TWO levels: SLSA L2 via cosign sign-blob in `_supply-chain.yml:90-111`, and SLSA L3 via `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator` in `release.yml:95-105`. Promote to required after one green release cycle.

A check moves from advisory to required by:

1. PR demonstrating the check is stable on the repo (≤1% false positive rate over 4 weeks).
2. ADR if the check changes architecture (rare).
3. Update to this file in the same PR that flips the branch protection rule.

## Type-aware linting

The `lint` check runs two type-aware ESLint rules in addition to the syntactic set: `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` and `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises` (both `error`). They use typescript-eslint's `projectService`, so `pnpm lint` requires a parseable TypeScript project graph: every package must have a `tsconfig.json` whose `include` covers the source being linted. A `tsconfig` parse failure surfaces as a lint error, not a typecheck error.

The override is scoped to source files only — config files (`*.config.ts`, `.storybook/**`), `tests/` helpers, `*.d.ts`, and test/spec/stories/scripts/migrations are excluded.

The override is gated OFF under lefthook (detected via the `LEFTHOOK` env var) so the pre-commit ESLint hook stays fast and syntactic. The full type-aware rules run only in CI's `pnpm lint`, which is the authoritative gate.

## Path filters

Path filters skip checks that are demonstrably orthogonal to the changed paths. Use sparingly.

### Workflow-trigger filters

Workflow-level `paths:` filters on the trigger block create stuck PRs when the workflow is a required status check (the skipped run reads as "missing" to branch protection). They are used ONLY on advisory workflows whose check name is not in `.github/rulesets/main.json` required list — currently `container-scan.yml`, `osv-scanner-pr.yml`, `db-migration-lint.yml`, `db-pgtap.yml`, `db-migration-idempotency.yml`, `db-schema-drift.yml`, `openapi-lint.yml`. **Do not add workflow-trigger `paths:` to required workflows like `ci.yml` or `gitleaks`.**

### In-workflow job/step skip via `changes` upstream

`ci.yml` runs `dorny/paths-filter` in a `changes` job and downstream jobs key off `needs.changes.outputs.<name>`. The `ci` aggregator at the bottom of `ci.yml` treats `skipped` as non-failure (only `failure|cancelled` red the aggregator), so skipped jobs do not break the required `ci` status check.

| Job / Step                                             | Gated on                                                | What skipping saves                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `storybook-build` + `storybook-test` (entire pipeline) | `packages/ui/**`                                        | ~220s on non-UI PRs                                        |
| `lint-typecheck` → `CDK Synth` step                    | `infra/cdk/**`, `apps/*/package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` | ~20-40s on PRs that don't touch CDK or dependency surfaces |

`storybook-test` is a 2-shard matrix (`--shard=N/2` on `@storybook/test-runner`). `storybook-build` runs once and uploads `packages/ui/storybook-static` as a 1-day-retention artifact; both shards download it. Net storybook wall on UI PRs: ~220-240s (sequential) → ~130-140s (build + max(shard)).

### `--affected` policy

`turbo --affected` scopes graph tasks to packages touched vs the PR base (or `HEAD^` on push to main). Applied selectively:

| Task                    | `--affected`? | Why                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `typecheck`             | Yes           | Type errors are local to changed package + downstream consumers; turbo's inputs hashing catches them.                                                            |
| `lint`                  | Yes           | Same reasoning.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `test` (vitest, non-db) | Yes           | Same. `test:coverage` also uses `--affected`.                                                                                                                    |
| `build`                 | **No**        | Deploy/release path consumes the FULL build artifact set (`apps/web/.next/standalone`, `apps/api/dist`, `apps/admin/.next`). A partial build = poisoned release. |
| `build-storybook`       | No            | Job already skipped when no UI change; full graph is fine when running.                                                                                          |
| `synth` (CDK)           | No            | Only runs at all when `infra/**` changed (path-filtered above).                                                                                                  |

`TURBO_SCM_BASE` is set to `${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha || 'HEAD^' }}` — the existing pattern from `ci.yml`'s `test:coverage` step. Full-graph fallback works on push to main and on the first commit of a new branch.

### `fetch-depth` policy

| Job                         | `fetch-depth` | Reason                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gitleaks`                  | `0`           | Full-history secret scan.                                                         |
| `lint-typecheck`            | `0`           | `turbo --affected` needs base ref reachable.                                      |
| `unit-test`                 | `0`           | Same.                                                                             |
| `storybook`, `build`, `e2e` | default (`1`) | No `--affected` here; full history is dead weight.                                |
| `changes` (paths-filter)    | default (`1`) | `dorny/paths-filter` reads the PR diff via the GitHub API, not local git history. |

## Remote cache

Turborepo Remote Cache runs on Cloudflare Workers + R2. Architecture decision: [ADR-0021](../adr/0021-turborepo-remote-cache-cloudflare.md). Operator runbook: [`docs/runbooks/CI-TURBO-REMOTE-CACHE.md`](../runbooks/CI-TURBO-REMOTE-CACHE.md).

| Layer                                    | What it caches                        | Backend                                                   | Quota                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Local `.turbo` (per-runner)              | Most recent task outputs              | Runner filesystem                                         | Tmpfs                |
| GitHub Actions cache (content-addressed) | `.turbo` snapshot keyed on input hash | GH built-in                                               | 10 GiB/repo (LRU)    |
| **Cloudflare Workers + R2 (remote)**     | All task outputs, cross-branch        | Worker `cache.afframe.com` → R2 bucket `turbo-cache-prod` | R2 free tier (10 GB) |

**Fail-open posture.** The composite step "Configure Turbo Remote Cache defaults" in `.github/actions/setup/action.yml` uses `continue-on-error: true`, and turbo CLI treats a remote-cache HTTP failure as a cache miss (rebuilds locally). No CI required-check depends on the remote cache being live. A Cloudflare outage at the cache layer slows CI on cached jobs but cannot red the build.

**Fork PRs do not access secrets.** PRs from forks have `secrets.TURBO_TOKEN` as an empty string. The composite step detects this and no-ops, falling back to the local + content-addressed GH Actions cache layers. Fork builds stay cold but functional.

**Cache integrity.** `turbo.json` sets `"remoteCache": { "signature": true }`. The CLI signs every artifact with HMAC-SHA256 using `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY` on write, and verifies on read. The Worker is a dumb passthrough — a compromised Worker cannot sign artifacts the CLI will trust.

**Required configuration** (set during PR-D pre-flight, see [runbook § 1](../runbooks/CI-TURBO-REMOTE-CACHE.md#1-first-time-deploy-done-once)):

- Repo variable `TURBO_API` — Worker URL (`https://cache.afframe.com`)
- Repo secret `TURBO_TOKEN` — Worker auth bearer
- Repo secret `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY` — HMAC key

When `TURBO_API` is empty (the v1 default before manual variable set), the composite no-ops and the remote layer is disabled — safe to merge PR-D Commit 2 before Commit 1's Worker is deployed.

## Concurrency

| Workflow                 | Group                                | cancel-in-progress |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| PR builds (`ci.yml`)     | `ci-${{ github.ref }}`               | `true`             |
| `main` builds            | `ci-main`                            | `false`            |
| Release builds (tag)     | `release-${{ github.ref }}`          | `false`            |
| Deploy AWS               | `deploy-aws-${{ env }}-${{ stack }}` | `false`            |
| Drift detect (scheduled) | `drift`                              | `true`             |

Rule: PR runs cancel; `main`, releases, and deploys never cancel. Cancellation on `main` or release would leave a half-built artifact on the registry.

## Branch protection summary (post-bootstrap)

`main`:

- Require PR before merging.
- Require review from CODEOWNERS.
- Require status checks: see "required" column above.
- Require linear history.
- Require signed commits (gpg or ssh).
- Restrict who can push directly: nobody.
- Allow squash merge only.

`v*` tags:

- Restrict creation to maintainers.
- Tag re-push blocked.
